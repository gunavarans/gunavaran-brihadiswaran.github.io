<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder which affects social
    interaction, communication, and leads to restricted and repetitive behavior. The phenotypic
    heterogeneity of ASD makes timely and accurate diagnosis challenging, requiring highly
    trained clinical practitioners. The development of automated approaches to ASD
    classification, based on integrated psychophysiological measures, may one day help expedite
    the diagnostic process.</p>

<p>The main objective of this research is to design and develop a machine learning based
    decision support system to classify ASD using Electroencephalography (EEG) and facial
    thermographic data indicating the severity range of the disorder. The research was carried
    out in multiple phases.</p>

<p> In phase one, the possibilities to use the minimum number of EEG channels were explored
    using statistical features extracted from noise filtered EEG data before and after Discrete
    Wavelet Transform and several learning models. Using Random Forest and Correlation-based
    Feature Selection, an accuracy level of 93% was achieved.</p>

<p>
    In the second phase, as an extension to phase one, the possibility of improving the
    classification with facial thermographic data was evaluated. The methodology used in this
    phase extracts a variety of feature sets and evaluates the possibility of using several
    learning models. Mean, standard deviation, and entropy values of the EEG signals and mean
    temperature values of regions of interest (ROIs) in facial thermograms were extracted as
    features. The integration of EEG and thermographic features achieved an accuracy of 94% with
    both Logistic Regression and Multi-Layer Perceptron classifiers.
</p>

<p>
    In the third phase, a multi-class classification was employed to identify the severity level
    of ASD.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, a web-based decision support system named "ASDGenus" for ASD classification was
    developed based on the third phase.
