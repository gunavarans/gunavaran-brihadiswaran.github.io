<p>k-mer counting is the process of counting k length substrings in a sequence. It is an
    important step in many bioinformatics applications including genome assembly, sequence error
    correction, and sequence alignment. Even though generating k-mer histograms seems simple and
    straightforward, processing large datasets efficiently with limited resources, especially
    memory, is very challenging. As the advancements in next-generation sequencing technologies
    have resulted in a tremendous growth of genomic data, it is inevitable for k-mer counters to
    be faster and more efficient. A lot of work has been done in the past decade to optimize
    k-mer counting.</p>

<p>
    The existing distributed memory solutions are specialized for high performance clusters and
    high speed networks which are costly to implement. Hence, the focus of this research is to
    build a k-mer counting and querying tool which is optimized for commodity clusters. We present Quill: a
    memory-efficient
    k-mer counting and a querying tool for commodity clusters. Quill manages to perform k-mer counting in a conventional
    computer cluster without relying on high-performance network
    interfaces or parallel file systems. Furthermore, Quill provides an
    additional advantage in cases where k-mer counting is required for
    multiple k-values in the same dataset.
</p>

<p>
    Quill shows a linear scaling
    for the k-mer counting stage when tested in a commodity cluster.
    The performance gain is more evident when executed with k values
    up to 22 and 28. Thus, Quill can be viewed as a cost-effective k-mer
    counting solution that can effectively use the combined computing
    power of a cluster of commodity-grade computers.
