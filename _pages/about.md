👨‍🎓 I am a Computer Engineering Ph.D. student at NC State University. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/jtuck/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">Prof. James Tuck</a>.  My research revolves around 🧬 DNA Data Storage. 

Earlier, I completed my Master's and Bachelor's degree at the <a href="https://uom.lk/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"> University of Moratuwa </a>

In my free time, I enjoy playing 🏸 badminton, 🥾 hiking, and 📷 photography.
