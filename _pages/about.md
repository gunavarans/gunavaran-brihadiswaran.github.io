I am a Computer Engineering 👨‍🎓 Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"> NC State University</a>, fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/jtuck/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">James Tuck</a>.  I enjoy interdisciplinary research and often work at the crossroads of computer systems, applied machine learning, and biology. My current research explores the fascinating potential of 🧬 DNA-based data storage. In particular, I focus on leveraging high-performance computing, machine learning, and parallel programming to design scalable, efficient storage systems that push the boundaries of what DNA can achieve as a medium for data storage.

I completed both my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees at the <a href="https://uom.lk/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"> University of Moratuwa</a>. I also had the opportunity to work as a research intern at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, where I was part of the <a href="https://asset-group.github.io/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"> ASSET Research Group</a>, optimizing data structures for byte-addressable non-volatile memory.

In my free time, I enjoy playing 🏸 badminton, 🥾 hiking, and 📷 photography.
